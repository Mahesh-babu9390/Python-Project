# Python GUI-Based Music player 
I created an GUI based mp3 music player in which we can play the song, pause it, resume it, and
navigate from the current song to the next song as well as previous songs.I had used Python and its
libraries. Libraries that i used are Tkinter widely used to build GUI library and the mixer module of
python library called Pygame for the frame work to manipulate the music and used filedialog to
browse a songs from the system. And OS library to interact with the Operating system. and finally i
used the Object-oriented Programming through these i completed the GUI based MP3 music
player.
